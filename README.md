## UX/UI & User Research

As part of my Final Project for the **Graphic Design Technology** program at UniCuritiba (2018), I led the complete research and interface design phase for TripCirco Company. This process included:

- **Desk Research**  
  Historical mapping of the circus in Brazil (arrival in 1830, first trapeze schools, Clown Therapy, Stankowich Circus, etc.).  
- **Audience Research**  
  Analysis of both potential and captive audiences: venues attended, number of performances seen, social classification, age ranges, and brand awareness.  
- **Persona Creation**  
  Detailed profiles outlining goals, challenges, and preferred communication channels.  
- **User Journey**  
  Mapping of the discovery, engagement, and conversion flow—highlighting both digital and on-site touchpoints.

These deliverables formed the foundation for user-centered wireframes and prototypes, aligning audience needs with TripCirco’s business objectives.
